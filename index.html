						  	<p>My name is Naveen Satish Kumar, I am an Australian-born Indian, and a proud RMIT student. I completed VCE in 2020 and am now studying Information Technology at RMIT. I enjoy playing and watching basketball and gaming on the PS5. I have an interest in cars and thoroughly enjoy driving them now that I have my license. Finally, I am a HUGE fan of Marvel and the US (United States) version of The Office. In terms of my interest in IT, my interest and passion for technology grew larger and larger, similar to the amount of money my parents invested into this “passion”. My broad end goal would be to utilize technology's potential to improve the world we live in, whether it be helping small businesses or working for the government. Currently my IT skills are quite simple, however I do now have some basic skills in python, SQL, HTML and CSS.</p>

							<p>My name is Stephen Horaitis and I am 19 years old as of the 10th of February. I have lived in Melbourne, Australia all my live and come from a Greek family, which therefore means that I can also speak, read, and write Greek. Currently, the highest level of education that I have completed is Year 12 VCE in 2020 and am now studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University. As for my hobbies, I have taken part in my local tennis club, soccer club and swimming club.

							<p>My name is Nivain Perera, I am 18 years old, I was born in Sri Lanka and moved to Australia in 2012. I previously studied at Mount Waverley Secondary College and completed VCE in 2020. I completed Software Development as a subject which further motivated me to undertake a Bachelor of Information Technology degree at RMIT. Outside of my studies, I play soccer and go to the gym to keep myself active. I have done taekwondo in the past for 6 years, I have participated in many competitions and have won multiple medals.</p>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Ron Shi</h2>

							<p>My name is Ron Shi, and I am a 20-year-old university studying a Bachelor of IT at RMIT. My parents are both Chinese, however I was born and raised here in Australia. I graduated high school in 2018 and studied science at Monash for 2 years before transferring. I primarily speak English, but I can also speak a conversational amount of Mandarin. I play games, mainly CS:GO and Fortnite, in my free time. Some other things I do in my spare time are watch movies, shows and anime, play basketball for a club and I occasionally enjoy editing photos and videos. I also have a pet beagle called Arrow.</p>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Angelo Alaan</h2>


							<p>I am 18 years old, born in Australia and have never gone overseas. I graduated from Gladstone Park Secondary College, and am a first year at RMIT University studying Bachelor of IT. I come from a Filipino background, but I can only speak English. Since I was in primary school, I have had an interest in IT, when I first used my dad's computer. My hobbies are playing games and hanging out with friends. I also have a cat named Kimi that I recently adopted.</p>

							<h2>Test Results</h2>
							<br>


							<h2 class="nametitle">Naveen Satish Kumar</h2>

							<p>I believe that the test results suggest that I am an outgoing person that uses logic, reasoning, and thinking rather than feeling, emotions, and going out on a limb by making ‘gut-feel’ decisions. The test results indicate that I have an executive personality, which reflects my love for leadership and delegation to successfully achieve desired outcomes.  The tests also suggest that I am not as creative. This can help the team as I can take charge and help facilitate, it also ensures that the team knows my weaknesses such as being inflexible and therefore someone who is stronger in that area can help.</p>

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Stephen Horaitis</h2>

							<p>These results indicate that I am a more introverted person, which would mean that within a work group environment I would be less talkative when compared with an extravert. This result did not surprise me. There are a few potential weaknesses that have been highlighted such as being unsystematic, unpredictable, and easily stressed. I will need to consider these and try to address them. Everyone will have a different personality, background, and experiences. It is for such reasons that when forming a group, we need to make sure that there is a mix of different personalities, to have broader ideas regarding the project.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Nivain Perera</h2>

							<p>The results will help me when I am forming groups. A team in which everyone interacts and contributes their own ideas will benefit the whole group because everyone will be aware of the steps that will be taken to accomplish a task. I would also like the team members to have a plan when they are trying to finish a task; being organized would help each team member keep track of their progress and increase their work rate because they are being organized and taking steps to finish a task.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Ron Shi</h2>

							<p>With my results in mind, my personality seems to make me more suited toward being a team player, rather than a team leader. My results also show that I can work both in groups and alone, however when in a group I would take more of a backseat. The Big Five personalities test gave me a very high score in agreeableness, and this accurately reflects on how I have worked in groups in the past – others would delegate the work and I would just do as I needed. This is probably a good choice seeing how the Myer-Briggs test gave me a 74% in prospecting, meaning I am more inclined to figuring things out as I go rather than plan the task at hand ahead of time and sticking to a schedule.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Angelo Alaan</h2>

							<p>These results show that in a team I would think logically but stick mostly on the observant side of the group as I am more introverted. However, I am not afraid to input on group discussions, I preferable would also follow someone else instead of being a leader in a group. I also learn better physically by doing instead of watching or reading. The results of one of the tests show that I have an extremely low imagination so I can be aided by someone who has a larger creativity and imagination than me.</p>

							<h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Naveen Satish Kumar</h2>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Elements Of The Job</h2>
							<p>This job would include working with the Google TV product team to improve the user experience through designing technology, implementing new features, and improving the use of these technologies and features. This position would involve the collection and analysis of data which would then help in the design and improvement of user experience. This position is extremely appealing to me as I love research and technology, as well as helping people by improving services. This job would allow me to be creative as well as logical in making decisions that at the need of the day, will improve the overall user experience.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Skills Of The Job</h2>
							<p>This position requires the applicant to have completed a bachelor’s degree in an applicable discipline, have 5 years of relevant experience in work with focusses on analysis, have database query experience such as SQL, and have tangible experience in analyzing data and problem solving. In addition to this, preferred tertiary qualifications for this role include Master of Science (MS), Master of Business Administration (MBA), or other advanced degrees and qualifications in a relevant field. Experience with relational database such as SQL queries and use of reporting tools such as Data Studio is preferred.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Career Plan</h2>
							<p>While studying at RMIT and building on my skills in programming, SQL, database, business analysis, design, and information management, etc. I will actively be looking for opportunities to gain 5 years of experience in an analytical role. I will also search for an undergraduate position which will further my skills and provide the experience needed for the job. If I am still not qualified enough, I will complete a master’s in information technology, helping my chances of getting the position.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Stephen Horaitis</h2>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Elements Of The Job</h2>
							<p>A solution architect’s job is to create a design for applications or systems within an organization. According to my personality traits, I tend to be independent and creative. Therefore, I believe that this type of role would better suit my personality. I would be able to create designs based on my vision, as opposed to working as a developer who merely creates based on another’s ideas.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Skills Of The Job</h2>
							<p>Currently, whilst I have to an extent, the skills in terms of my ability to communicate, discipline, teamwork, perseverance, and problem solving, I still lack significantly in these areas. Furthermore, I am completely new to learning the tools required within this field. The closest I have come to learning how to work with anything technology related was in my year 10 programming class, in which we were briefly taught how to use the program “Scratch”. Therefore, I recognize that I have no usable skills in technology currently, but I am here to learn! The skills required for this particular position include: Many years of experience working within the IT industry. Exceptional communication skills. Enhanced analytical skills. Documentation and technical writing skills. Ability to interpret business requirements into technology solutions. Relevant IT qualifications.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Career Plan</h2>
							<p>Upon completing my Bachelor of Information Technology, I will begin by starting off in a developer role, and over time, complete numerous certifications such as the AWS Solutions Architect certification (Amazon Web Services 2020, para. 6) but also, the equivalent Microsoft credentials like “Azure Solutions Architect Expert” certificate (Krasny 2021, para. 1). Furthermore, as I progress, I will take part in role-based industry training and lastly obtain a mentor for insight regarding the occupation of being a solutions architect. Lastly, I will engage in self learning using applications such as Pluralsight to enhance my skills and “adopt new tools” (Pluralsight 2020, para. 1).</p>

							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Elements Of The Job</h2>
							<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence may be influential in the field of technology because it can transform the way we communicate with everyday things. This work post by Elida is appealing because it addresses Artificial Intelligence. Elida also makes use of their technology to support charity; their emphasis on supporting people in need stands out to me because they have the potential to use cutting-edge technology to improve the lives of those who do not have access to modern technology. Elida also emphasizes the importance of working in a team environment, this appeals to me because sharing and exchanging ideas in a group setting can be a more productive way to accomplish a task.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Skills Of The Job</h2>
							<p>To be successful at Elida, the company expects certain skills such as knowledge of Microservices and Serverless software architecture. Cloud computing experience is needed. Having sufficient experience with modern SDLC and CI/CD pipelines, as well as previous experience designing backends for commercial-grade distributed applications. Elida also prefers someone who has worked with various cloud computing platforms, such as Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure. Someone with Node or Python experience is also preferred by the business.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Career Plan</h2>
							<p>I have some Python experience, but I am eager to learn the skills required for this role. I plan to enrol in a Microsoft Azure course that will equip me with the requisite skills and knowledge to comprehend cloud computing. I believe that learning Python at RMIT would provide me with sufficient programming knowledge, but I am also willing to take a Node or Python course outside of RMIT to further my knowledge. To gain experience with SDLC and CI/CD pipelines, I can enrol in an Udemy online course that covers all of the required components for SDLC and CI/CD pipeline use.</p>

							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Elements Of The Job</h2>
							<p>A Cyber Security Analyst is responsible for protecting a company's network and systems from cyber-attacks. I am interest in security online in aspects of both defending and attacking. As once someone becomes familiar with the internet a whole range of options and information is opened to the user.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Skills Of The Job</h2>
							<p>Being a cyber security analyst requires: a bachelor’s in computer science, programming, or software engineering which I am currently not in, hoping to be able to switch into. Security analysts require a huge IT knowledge from cybersecurity laws to computer techniques, they also need to be analytical, detailed, communicative, and creative which I am still largely lacking in.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Career Plan</h2>
							<p>When finishing my bachelor of IT, I am hoping to get into a postgrad for Cyber security, potentially part-time whilst interning at Australia Post in which I current work at.

								<h2 class="nametitle">3) HAVING LOOKED AT THE BURNING GLASS DATA, HAS YOUR OPINION OF YOUR IDEAL JOB CHANGED? WHY OR WHY NOT?</h2>
								<p>Naveen: Personally, my opinion of my ideal job has only gone greater. This is because the data suggests that the requirements and skills needed for my ideal job are in high demand by employers which will help me develop and further my progression in the IT industry in the future. For example, in my ideal job one of the major IT-specific skill they were after was SQL and this was the number one it-specific skill employers were in demand for according to burning glass.</p>
								<p>Stephen: In terms of whether my opinion of my ideal job has changed, I would have to say that currently, it has not.  This is due to a few reasons.  First, upon looking over the Burning Glass data sets, it is evident that my initial ideal job is rated as the highest in demand (987).  This then means that it will be much easier and more likely for me to receive a job in this field.</p>
								<p>Ron: Aside from SQL, the general and IT skills required for my ideal job are like the skills that many employees look for. I still believe that the position of a game developer is something that I am passionate about, and it will be a job that I will find fulfilling. It will be helpful however if I am unable to get my ideal job, that so many skills I have developed at that point are very transferrable among the IT industry.</p>
								<p>Angelo:  After discovering the burning glass data I have become interested in SQL as it is a large skill in demand, I have also discovered that I need to work on my communication skills which I have stated were lacking, as it is another extremely demanded skill. Furthermore, I have become less interested in Python and more curious about Java as JavaScript and JAVA seem to be important for an IT employees' skills.</p>
							  <p>Nivain:  My opinion on my ideal job has certainly changed, it made me realize the importance of acquiring and applying skills such as JavaScript in the role of a Senior Systems Engineer. Furthermore, Senior Systems Engineer is categorized under the top titles by Burning Glass which highlights the importance of using my skills acquired from the course at RMIT and applying these skills to earn a placement at a job under the position of a Senior Systems Engineer.</p>

 							<h2> Interview Questions & Transcript </h2>
							<h2 class="nametitle"> Tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h2>
								<p>I am a director of technology.  This involves managing a multidisciplinary team of technology professionals.  Roles such as developers, infrastructure professionals, support operators, project managers, business managers, solution designers, etc are the kind of roles you would find within the team.  I liaise with business stakeholders to translate business needs into innovative technology solutions.  I set technology roadmaps and strategies to deliver the organizational strategy and competitive advantage.  I direct teams to deliver on strategic and tactical initiatives.  My day to day involves multiple meetings with various stakeholders, to ensure timely information and direction.  The role is not a hands-on technical role, with the main skills being stakeholder management, negotiation, strategy, business case development and other management skills, but of course a broad technology understanding of current and future technologies and how they may be best utilized is required.
								</p>
								<h2 class="nametitle"> Please tell us about the industry you work in.  </h2>
								<p>It is a health-care regulation as part of a government agency.  As a regulator, it is not profit driven, nor do competitors exist.  IT delivery and business strategies are driven by regulatory need and risk to the public.  Many projects and initiatives are driven out of government or public safety requirements.  Being a government agency, decision making takes times and it is a very consultative environment (i.e., ideas and change needs to be heavily socialized and accepted before enacted).
								</p>
								<h2 class="nametitle"> What other kinds of work do you have to do?  </h2>
								<p>I have got to do research, legal work (contract reviews and contract negotiations), run large procurement tenders, participate in industry events and conferences, responding to and writing lots of emails (hundreds a day).  Also, I need to manage a team, conduct performance reviews, participate and conduct meetings, and run workshops.
								</p>
								<h2 class="nametitle"> Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.   </h2>
								<p>My direct reports (enterprise manager, change and transition manager, service and deliver manager, property and sustainability manager), I liaise with them approximately 30% percent of my time to manage the teams deliverables (project work and BAU).  These direct reports, manage the various areas of IT and the underlying technical specialists.  For instance, the enterprise platform manager, manages application development and support, the test team, the business analysis team, digital services, and information management teams.  50% of my time, I work with business executives (i.e., the CEO, CFO, COO, etc), the managers of other departments of the business in order to maintain transparent and opened communications between IT and the business.  It is through these interactions that requirements, strategies, and updates were exchanged and created.  The remainder of the time (20%) is spent liaising with technical specialists, and vendors in order to exchange information on work engagements (planned or in-flight).
								</p>
								<h2 class="nametitle"> Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.   </h2>
								<p> The main interaction is with my direct reports.  There will be various meetings established, each with its own agenda.  Weekly one-on-one meetings are established, where I discuss specific team matters with each line manager.  In the one-on-one meetings, the team performance, risks, challenges, and issues are discussed.  There is a bi-directional exchange of information between the manager and I; they will provide options, issues, and ideas on the various matters, and an open discussion on the team and other matters and I provide updates from the executive, specific direction, and any required support to the manager.</p>   
								<p> There are various fortnightly meetings established with a broader audience, which include all my line managers and other technical leads.  These meetings are operational in nature and are there to maintain operational oversight of standard operating processors and management controls; basically, checking to see that things are working properly.  In these meetings, various operational reports are walked through.  In some of these meetings, approvals are invited for various changes to occur (example: changes to production systems, endorsing a solution design, approving a deviation from standard, etc).</p>  
								<p> I interact with project managers, and business analysts in project status update meetings and steering committee meetings.  I am the sponsor of the project, so I provide direction to the project.  In steering committee meetings, for the projects that I may or may not be the sponsor of, engagement is more formal and is more about decision making for the project.</p>  
								<p> I have monthly meetings with the entire team, where I communicate our cooperate direction and strategy, team matters, our progress to date, challenges and opportunities, and targets for the next period.  These are some of the formal structured meetings I will have with IT professionals, but there is also daily informal communication: the corridor chat, the desk visit, the email or phone communication, etc.  These are more quick decision or update kind of communications, or just a social interaction.</p>
								</p>
								<h2 class="nametitle"> What about your interactions with clients or investors?   </h2>
								<p>My clients are internal costumers.  As I previously mentioned, 50% of my day is spent liaising with internal management.  There are various forums where this occurs, from the formal meetings that are established (example: strategy workshop, townhall meetings, etc.) where everyone engages and provides updates on progress metrics or future plans to informal meetings, generally on a one on one basis, where I will periodically touch base with key stakeholders to ensure that their motivations, drivers, needs, concerns, and ideas are captured, listened to, and discussed.  Doing this helps build rapport and trust between my clients and me and ensures, broadly speaking, IT delivery is on the right track.  In terms of delivery itself, the team will liaise directly and work with the business customer to ensure the optimal outcomes (the business customer is part of the change, signs off on the requirement and the deliverable).
								</p>
								<h2 class="nametitle"> What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.  </h2>
								<p>Most of my time is spent in meetings, as outlined in previous questions.  My time is spent preparing for those meetings (preparing presentations, reviewing and commenting on documents, researching, preparing proposals, preparing reports, and communicating).
								</p>
								<h2 class="nametitle"> Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?  </h2>
								<p>Stakeholder management is the hardest part of the job.  Communicating technical strategies and working with non-technical people to approve expenditure and deliver solutions, is very challenging.  Just “keeping the lights on” requires significant investment, this is often lost on finance executives and other managers seeking to maximize their returns on investment.  There is often a disconnect between IT and the rest of the business and it is the responsibility of IT management to educate and inform the business in order to bridge that gap.  In a health regulatory environment this is quite challenging as management has a low maturity level of IT practices and needs, thus the divide and challenge is much greater.
								</p>
								<h2 class="nametitle"> Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?  </h2>
								<p>IT is about delivering change.  IT professionals are change agents and no modern change is possible without it.  Basically, IT professionals make the future happen.  As an IT director, I have a role to play in every step of a change from the formation of the idea, having it approved, and its design to delivery of that idea and all the technical teams that need to come together to deliver it.  It is my role that actually sees and works across the entire delivery landscape albeit at reduced detail.  I am also held accountable should there be a failure in delivery.

 							<h2 class="major">IT Tech</h2>
 						 	<h2 class="nametitle">Cybersecurity</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/cybersecurity.jpg" alt="" /></span>
 						  	<p>
							The internet is like the sun, as the internet expands more problems and exploits are prevalent in recent society. But cybersecurity prevents those problems and exploits and includes the “measures used to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems and information.” (ACSC 2021, Glossary) It is important to be secure online as several threats are prevalent and lurking, these threats include: illegal crypto-mining, data spillage, DoS (Denial of service attacks), Hacking, Identify theft, Malicious insiders, Malware, Phishing, Ransomware, Scams and Web shell malware (ACSC 2021).
							</p>

							<p>
							As technology keeps advancing, new methods of security breaches appear. However, cybersecurity is still seeing an increase in demand and attacks are decreasing, according to Accenture “The total number of cyberattacks dropped 11 percent, from 232 to 206 targeted attacks.” (Accenture 2021, The basics seem better) The decrease of cyberattacks is also shown through “a larger drop of 27 percent in the number of security breaches which indicates the basics seem to be improving”. (Accenture 2021, The basics seem better).
							</p>

							<p>
							Despite this in 2019 “68% of business leaders [still] feel their cybersecurity risks are increasing” (Accenture 2019, New risks from innovation and growth). However Cybersecurity is a risk not limited to businesses, “A survey by the AIC found that identity crime 1 in 4 Australians have been a victim of identity crime at some point in their lives” (Australian Government Department of Home Affairs, 2021) and 68% of the victims have not reported the misuse of their information, this means that 17% of the Australian population has had their personal information misused without reporting it at all this is largely due to the lack of knowledge users have of cybersecurity, the AIC stated that 25.1% of the cases police did not do anything, 12.6% were too embarrassed to report it, 19.3% don’t know where to report it and 12.5% did not know that identify theft was a crime. According to the AIC only 32% of reports were accepted, despite each victim spending an average of 34 hours repairing the damage caused by identify theft. (AIC, 2021). And this is only one of the listed cyber-crimes above.
							</p>

							<p>
							And still despite this another huge presence is being developed, quantum computers, quantum computers have the potential to change the entire structure of the internet itself. Quantum computing overpowers classical computers as it utilizes qubits, whereas classic computers only use ones and zeros, qubits have a ‘superposition’ state that allows them to be a one and a zero. Allowing two qubits to represent four scenarios at the same time. (Brandmark, 2021) To put it in perspective Google’s Sycamore quantum processor calculated one million measurements on a quantum circuit, which took around 200s, which a state-of-the-art supercomputer would take 10,000 years to complete. (Physics world 2019, para. 4) Based on the processing speed of the quantum chips, both security and threat wise cybersecurity could be changed immensely. However, quantum computers are still far from becoming a possibility as problems such as quantum decoherence which comes from “aspects of the environment: changing magnetic and electric fields, radiation from warm objects, or cross talk between qubits” (Scientific American 2020, para. 3). Nonetheless IBM (International business Machines corporation) has still promised to develop numerous quantum computers over the next few years coming from the ‘Falcon’ – 27 qubits 2019, ‘Hummingbird’ – 65 qubits 2020, ‘Eagle’ – 127 qubits 2021, ‘Osprey’ – 433 qubits 2022 and ‘Condor’ – 1121 qubits in 2023. (See Figure 1)

							<p>
							A prime example of the importance of cyber security is quantum computing poses as it poses huge impact on cryptography, and in turn affects the crypto mining market heavily. For example, Bitcoin is a system for transferring value, a Bitcoin user is responsible for generating their own random address, and the user’s computer generates a random secret address that is required to transfer Bitcoin. (Deloitte, 2021) However a user with a quantum computer with access to another user’s public key could easily forge the private key and spend their Bitcoin which poses a huge problem for the crypto community. However, Quantum computers are not only threating crypto users but also the encryption and security of everyone on the internet is being threatened especially any type of asymmetric key pairs. Just Like how a quantum computer can crack a Bitcoin users private key, quantum computers can easily brute force and crack a password that uses factorization and prime numbers (havened, 2017) in 1 hour which would take a classic computer 78 million hours to do. It was also estimated that only 120 quantum computers were needed to disrupt every HTTPS connection in 2 seconds in 2017. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Cyber-security goes hand in hand with the advancement of technology and as technology keeps advancing so will the jobs related to it. Australia’s cyber security growth network sates that the government has spent 9% more per year and employed 4000 workers per year since 2017. The ASCS found that “90% of Australian organizations faced some form of attempted or successful cyber security compromise” (Seek 2021, para. 1). Cybersecurity affects everything and everyone online ensuring that companies, governments and individual’s information is kept private and secure. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Cybersecurity is an important part of everyone’s life, just as people lock their houses and cars to file cabinets and safes, they should lock their phones and information online, almost all information nowadays has an online copy, and an insecure lock could lead to a leak in information. Cybersecurity is prevalent is everyone’s daily lifestyle as users unlock their phones and computers, they also login to websites and applications posing way more information to be kept secret and as more information needs to be secured a large demand in cybersecurity employment for me as an individual is a welcome opportunity as it creates more positions in my ideal job. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Cybersecurity also creates an opportunity for more efficient data protection than physical security with thousands of “hidden” locks to be created to protect sensitive data. This affects everyone online as anyone who has access to a computer can encrypt and secure data to prevent access to anyone else. Despite this however many do not protect their online information as much as they should, which is portrayed through the massive identity thieving online. Myself, my family and friends often share passwords to several services and unlike creating copies of a physical key or sharing even more sensitive information so they can access the service, it is much easier and safer to do. Cybersecurity has already become an essential part in modern society and therefore has already affected everyone around me, but the advancement in security will create a more secure, efficient and effective method of information encryption and security. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Overall cybersecurity nowadays is impossible to live without, as it would basically be living in a house with no doors and open windows, allowing strangers to pass in and out with no protection at all. And as services such as TLS keep improving to prevent the threats of the advancement of technology such as quantum computers, cybersecurity is an essential part of IT Technology.

							<h2 class="nametitle">CLOUDS, SERVICES, SERVERS </h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/cloud.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Clouds, services, and servers look like three completely different things on the surface. In the IT industry cloud refers to in simple terms, the internet but using just software rather than software and hardware. Services refer to tasks that are completed with the assistance of technology. Finally, servers simply store, send, and receive data. However, what do these three things have in common… Cloud Computing. Wikipedia (2021) defines Cloud computing as “the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.” This relates to the cloud as it is all about storage and the use of software to store rather than hardware. In terms of services and servers cloud computing is all about utilizing the cloud to complete services such as retrieving data as efficiently as possible and the cloud is known best as a virtual server, therefore ticking that box.</p>
							<p>At this current moment cloud computing is providing millions of users' access to resources such as storage, applications, and services, over a network, typically the Internet. In terms of for the everyday user, one of the most prominent cloud services is things such as iCloud and Google drive. These act as virtual servers for people to store things such as photos and videos. In terms of services they can retrieve, store, and organize their data.</p>
							<p>The future of cloud computing is no doubt a massive industry that will continue to grow tremendously over the following years through constant funding. I believe that we are moving towards a cloud only future due to the constantly evolving technology and plethora of benefits due to using this service. In terms of the specific upgrades to cloud computing, the biggest would be due to the exponential growth of cloud services. In this day and age, it is only getting clearer how useful cloud computing can be for things such as working from home. It is expected that “The global public cloud infrastructure market will grow 35 percent to $120 billion in 2021” (Goodison, 2021). What does this mean for the future?</p>
							<p>With cloud services becoming the center of data management improvements must be made to facilitate the huge growth of this industry. With more and more companies moving and growing their business through cloud services it is in no doubt that we are going to see changes in terms of the main cloud providers. Currently the biggest are Amazon, Microsoft, and Google however we already seeing other companies such as china’s Alibaba coming close to becoming bigger then google in terms of cloud providers.</p>
							<p>In terms of technological changes to cloud services, and technology overall, is the introduction and/or the development of artificial intelligence. AI is a field of technology that requires access to large data sets and lots of power. Through the cloud, these features can be accessed and therefore AI can be successfully utilized without having to make big investments. To summarize, the cloud is acting as a platform to democratize access to AI. Furthermore, with the implementation of AI in cloud services, the cloud can have features such as powering a self-managing cloud with AI, improving data management with AI, utilizing dynamic cloud services and much more.</p>
							<p>To summarize, cloud services is the way of the future, it is an ever-growing industry that presents to many benefits to overlook whilst introducing new as well as improved services and infrastructure.</p>
							<p>Already we are seeing cloud services have a huge impact on current outdated IT infrastructures. As cloud services grows and grows there will be great impacts, some being good and some being bad. In terms of positives/advantages of cloud services/computing, some of the main ones include easy accessibility, huge cloud storage, data backup and recovery and lower costs just to name a few. With all these new and improved features however also comes problems such as having to rely on good internet speed, possibility of outages, ongoing costs and the biggest one being security.</p>
							<p>With data management and services going fully digital, the IT world will see a lot of changes as well as unfortunate redundancies and job losses. Before cloud services, the best way to manage, store and receive data was through physical data centers. These data centers needed physical security around the data center as information could be physically stolen and therefore detrimental to the company. With data centers looking to soon be taken over by the cloud, physical protection and specific data managers will become redundant. This is because physical security is no longer needed as the data is stored in the virtual cloud. It is safe to say that in the near future data centers will be a thing of the past.</p>
							<p>Although it is unfortunate that the physical security job will become redundant, cloud computing will also introduce new jobs and therefore help the industry further. As cloud services are being used predominantly by businesses to maximize efficiency, Enterprise Architects will be a new job that can help businesses utilize IT to their advantage. With the cloud being such an important service, new roles would need to be created such as cloud system engineer, cloud alliance
							manager and cloud cost manager just to name a few. These roles will help maintain, utilize, and share the great thing that is the cloud.</p>
              <p>With cloud computing already starting to take over, it is clear to see that the cloud will in no doubt play a vital part in most people's daily lives in the future if it is not already now. One of the biggest changes to cloud computing in the future is the improvement and development of it.</p>
							<p>In terms of everyday life, something that me, my friends, my family, and everyone I know does is take photos on their phones. Now this process may not change with the cloud but storing, sharing, and managing these photos is about to get a whole lot easier, quicker, and more efficient. Just recently I attended a family members birthday party, and a lot of photos were taken by everyone. As sending these to everyone through SMS would take forever, we decided to make a WhatsApp group chat and send all the photos and videos onto there as this was the fastest way. This is a perfect example as how cloud services in the future can improve our daily lives. As the cloud develops and becomes quicker and quicker, one person will be able to setup a virtual server which is specific to that event and from there everyone can send and take photos almost instantaneously without having to worry about losing photos and backing them up.</p>
							<p>I believe that overall, with the cloud getting smarter, quicker, and more efficient, physical drives and servers will be a thing of the past and cloud will be the norm. I believe that this will affect everyday people as devices such as phones and computers will ditch storage and move fully to virtual storage as in the future this will be more efficient and less costly.</p>
							<p>In conclusion I believe the biggest change in the future in terms of cloud services will be the way we store and receive data. With the way cloud is advancing in terms of implementation of new technology such as AI and development of cloud, this in no doubt will be a positive change for everybody.</p>

							<h2 class="nametitle">BLOCKCHAINS & CRYPTOCURRENCY</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/blockchains.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>A blockchain is a chain of blocks that contain information. This technology can be dated back to 1991 where a group of researchers created it for the use of timestamping digital documents, so that it not possible to tamper with those documents. This technology of blockchains went by mostly unused until 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto created the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin. A blockchain can be described as a digital ledger that is open to everyone, and anyone can add to it, but no one can change it. 
							</p>
							<p>This interesting property of blockchains of not being able to be altered is why it is slowly being adopted by many different companies across different fields and different countries. But how does this work? Each block in a blockchain has three main components. It contains data, a hash and the hash of the previous block. The data stored in each block will differ, depending on the type of blockchain it is on. For example, the data in a block in Bitcoin will contain information on a transaction. This will include the sender, receiver, amount of Bitcoin sent and the date and time.
							</p>
							<p>A hash is something similar to a digital fingerprint and will identify a block and all of its contents and will always be unique. Because the blocks hash can identify its contents and data, changing the information on a block will change its hash, meaning the block is no longer the same block. This helps to identify change on the blockchain. Finally, a block will also contain the hash of a previous block. This creates the ‘chain’ element of a blockchain.
							</p>
							<p> Because each block has its own hash and the hash of a previous block, this means that if someone attempts to change data on a block, the hash of that singular block is changed. However, the next block on the blockchain will now hold an invalid hash of the previous block and the next block after that too. Changing the data of a singular block will cause the rest of the blockchain to be invalid and the system will know something is wrong. A problem in the blockchain is easily identifiable because it can be traced to exactly where in the blockchain a problem has started. This system is very secure, however these days, the hash system alone cannot protect against all tampering and hacks. Computers these days can tamper with one block and calculate hundreds or even thousands of hashes for the following blocks, making the blockchain valid. 
							</p>
							<p> Today, we utilize two more components that make the blockchain that is as secure as it is today. Blocks in blockchains have a mechanism called proof-of-work. This mechanism slows down the creation of new blocks, as each new block will also be ‘certified’ with a proof-of-work. Now trying to tamper with a blockchain not only includes having to recalculate hundreds or thousands of new hashes but will need to certify all these new blocks as well.
							</p>
							<p>Finally, blockchains will also be distributed. Unlike many other servers or programs where a central entity or computer will manage a system, blockchains use a peer-to-peer network that anyone is allowed to join. When a person joins, they receive a full copy of the blockchain, called a node. When a new block is now created, the block is sent to everyone on the blockchain and each node will verify the block to make sure it has not been tampered with. Once the block has been verified, each node will accept this block and add it to their blockchain. Nodes will communicate with each other to come to a consensus. They agree on which blocks are valid and which are not. </p>
							<p>To successfully tamper on a modern blockchain, a hacker would have to recalculate a hash and certify every following block on the blockchain a proof-of-work and would need to do this across over half of the peers on the network. This becomes almost impossible to do once even just a couple people join the network, making blockchains very secure.
							</p>
							<p>One of the big factors in the popularization of blockchain technology is its decentralized nature. No one big entity controls the blockchain, instead all the peers do. One of the biggest uses of blockchain technology stems from this factor. Currencies such as the US dollar (USD) or the Australian dollar (AUD) are centralized- there is a central authority that will effectively control the value and distribution of currency, in the case of the USD and AUD, the US and Australian governments. There is nothing to stop the governments from printing out more money, inflating the market and in turn, devalue their respective currency. In fact, due to the ongoing effects of the corona virus, many governments have printed more money in the form of stimulus checks reducing the value of their currency. </p>
							<p>This is where cryptocurrencies come in. Cryptocurrencies are essentially digital tokens created from code, all of which were created and exchanged on a blockchain. This allows for any user across the globe to exchange funds via almost instantaneous transactions with absolute security. Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies were created with a limited supply in mind- that only a certain amount of the currency would ever be in existence to prevent inflation. Other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum employed a mining cap of 18 million tokens per year. 
							</p>
							<p> Over the past few years since the popularization of Bitcoin, people have realized that blockchain technology could have multitude of potential use cases. The technology is immutable, efficient, transparent and offers security and traceability to businesses. The data stored can be used for just about anything from inventory management to media licensing and will include greater security and convenience. Take transactions for example- usually to transfer an amount of money, banks will withhold the money transferred for up to 24 hours, until those funds arrive at the receiver’s account. Payments to companies for goods and services can be ‘pending’ even longer, up to 5 working days. Without the use of an intermediatory on a blockchain, funds can be sent and settled within a matter of seconds. </p>
							<p>Another potential use case could be movement of in person or mail voting to digital voting. The recent 2020 US presidential election had many people doubting the authenticity of the vote results, however this could be avoided from occurring again if the vote could be set up on a system with a blockchain implementation. Votes could be traced, and it would be impossible to tamper with results. Many healthcare systems have already been moving away from paper record keeping and are developing blockchain systems to manage their medical data.  
							</p>
							<p>Blockchain technology will be the future of storing and sharing data. Companies and corporations from all sectors are already moving to a blockchain system, drawn by its security and functionality. In future, all types of records and transactions could be stored on a blockchain. Courthouse minutes could be uploaded to a blockchain, warehouses could update their sales and inventory on a blockchain, even university assignment submissions could take place on a blockchain.</p>
							<p>Our society is moving toward a digital world, where daily activities like education, shopping and taxes and bills can all be done in the comfort of our home in front of our screens. When so many of our activities are all online, there is an only a growing concern for the safety of our digital identities. Why not implement a blockchain system into these activities so that what we do is more convenient and so that we can have reassurance that our activities are more secure? Blockchains are already on the way to becoming a foundation to our generation’s technological world. Cryptocurrencies making a start to becoming a world-wide currency that consumers can used to purchase products. Right now, there are thousands of products and services being created around blockchains that can provide us with solutions for our changing needs. It may take a while, but in 5 years, 10 years, blockchains will become an integral part of our society.

							<h2 class="nametitle">Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/selfdrivingcar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p class="cardescription">-First self driving car by Norman Bel Geddes</p>
							 <br>
							 <br>
 						  	 <p>The first ever autonomous vehicle was created by Norman Bel Geddes in 1939, Tesla now dominates the car industry by producing autonomous vehicles which highlights the technological advancements made over the past few decades. Most autonomous vehicles are common in electric cars, the use of autonomous vehicles have risen over the past and car manufacturers such as BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche, etc.… have considered progressing towards electric cars that has the capability to drive by itself. </p>
				     			 <br>
							 <p>Autonomous vehicle’s function using sensors, machine learning, algorithms and processors that work together to allow the vehicle to have a self-driving functionality. Using cameras and LIDAR (light detection and ranging) sensors, self-driving vehicles can craft a map of its surroundings which allows it to safely travel by itself around obstacles. Currently, Tesla has made the most advances in the self-driving car industry. The traditional features in a self-driving car can include the use of a LIDAR sensor to map the vehicle’s surroundings, the LIDAR sensor is most used by car manufacturers such as Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo, Audi, etc.… However, Tesla uses a different method which consists of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, radars, and processors instead of a LIDAR scanner. Elon Musk (the founder of Tesla) believed that the cameras in a Tesla car can mimic the human eye, and the processors can mimic the brain. Ultrasonic sensors can send sound waves which will eventually bounce of an object, this is used to measure this distance between the car and the object. With the help of machine learning, the combination of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, radars, and processors have drastically improved a Tesla’s ability to navigate through different traffic conditions.</p>
						      	<br>
						    	<p>Tesla’s self-driving capability will improve overtime due to machine learning and software updates that are pushed out by Tesla, therefore Tesla’s self-driving feature will only continue to get better in the future. To improve the self-driving capability of a car, processors can be updated and improved to decrease the time it takes to process an image from the cameras. By decreasing processing times, the likelihood of a crash occurring is reduced which ensures that the driver can use the self-driving feature without have to worry about the safety of the feature. Clearer cameras can send a clearer image to the sensors which can be processed with efficiency, clearer images will also make the process of machine learning easier since the objects in an image can be clearly identified. Better ultrasonic sensors can also be fitted to the vehicle to make object detection more accurate; this also reduces the chance of error when it comes to the functionality of self-driving in a car.</p>
								<br>
								<p>In the future, self-driving cars will improve when more individuals choose to use the feature. Tesla manages to improve their self-driving feature everyday through the machine learning system, due to Tesla’s popularity, they can gather data from different drivers around the world to ensure that their self-driving feature can handle different obstacles. With the processors and technical equipment in a self-driving car such as a Tesla, they also can utilize other features such as traffic aware cruise control and auto-steer. Traffic aware cruise control works using ultrasonic sensors, it can gather the speed of surrounding vehicles which then allows it to match the speed of your own vehicle. Auto-steer works alongside with traffic aware cruise control, auto-steer helps them to keep the car within the lines of a lane. In conclusion, self-driving cars have made significant improvements with the help of software and hardware developments made over the past few decades.</p>
								<br>
								<p>The development of self-driving cars will certainly change the way we drive on roads in the future. Popular car manufacturers have already considered creating cars that have the capability to drive by itself on busy roads, they have made plans to decide which technologies they can use, and which processors will be used in the car. A future where cars have the capability of driving by itself can create a safer driving environment for the driver, as well as other drivers on the road.</p>
								<br>
								<p>However, there can still be road accidents that can be caused by errors within the processors in the vehicle, or through human error. Processing errors can derive from a lack of machine learning, but it could be improved when self-driving cars are more popular in the future since more people will be training the machine learning system.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Despite the benefits of self-driving cars, there can be job losses due to the self-driving feature alone. The company Uber is in the process of testing cars where the car has the capability to drive by itself which means a driver is not required, this can greatly affect those who rely on Uber as their primary source of income if self-driving Uber cars are prioritized in the future. Alongside uber, public transport such as buses and trains could also be equipped with the self-driving feature, this could also result in a greater loss of jobs. Despite the loss of jobs, it can create specific jobs that are required to maintain a car’s self-driving feature. Even though a car uses machine learning to improve its self-driving feature, there could be jobs that are required to program and debug any errors within the machine learning process. These jobs can multiply in the future when more car manufacturers are transitioning into electric cars that have a self-driving functionality.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Self-driving cars could have a slight impact on me. Drivers who recently received their probationary license may not be able to utilize the self-driving feature in a car since the feature is not fully safe yet. P plate drivers like me, may still have to drive the car manually since it is the safest option for now. However, in the future, self-driving cars could be improved which may allow anyone to use the feature even if they hold a probationary license.</p>
								<br>
								<p>If I could use a self-driving car soon, it would be a great experience to see the different processors and technologies in the car work together to create a functional self-driving car. A fully functional and safe self-driving car will allow me and many other to multitask during a road trip. Whilst following safety rules, I would be able to do simple tasks such as enjoying the view or writing something down in the car which could save me time. Self-driving cars can be drastically different from normal cars, and it will take some time to get used to.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Since the feature is new and most of the world’s population has not experienced a self-driving car, some people might find it difficult to use the feature. However, self-driving cars could be beneficial towards the elderly. Most of the elderly may need to use public transport if they need to reach a certain destination, self-driving cars will allow them to reach their designated destination with ease. Some elderly individuals may initially find it difficult to navigate through the features of a self-driving car, but car manufacturers such as Tesla has made it easy to access the feature, Tesla has integrated a user-friendly infotainment system in their car which makes it easier for the driver to explore and navigate through certain features of a car.</p>

							<h2 class="major">PROJECT IDEA – SAFE RAP</h2>  
 						  	<h2 class="major">Overview</h2>
	<p>Thousands of animals are euthanized each year in the USA and Australia alone.  This application seeks to reduce those numbers. “SAFE RAP” will be both an Android and IOS application targeted towards those who are looking to adopt a pet and/or help contribute to shelter animals.  This application will also be catered for Animal shelters and other organisations that deal with abandoned pets, allowing them to put the animal up for adoption via the application.  This application will primarily run similar to a ‘dating app’, in which the animals (primarily dogs and cats) will be put on the page with a small bio, to which the users are able to swipe left or right depending on which they are interested in.  Information is exchanged as well as any payment for animals rescued.  Users will also be able to donate to the animal shelters. </p>

	<h2 class="major">Motivation</h2>
	<p>The number of dogs and cats put in shelters and euthanized each year is alarmingly high.  “Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats)” in the U.S. alone (Pet Statistics 2015, para. 2) with a total of “28,072” dogs, and “45,364” cats being brought into the RSPCA in the 2019-2020 financial year (RSPCA 2021, para. 3) . (Figure 1) </p>
	<span class="image main"><img src="images/Figure 5.png" alt="" /></span>
	<p>Whilst this application may not solve the problem at hand, it gives the animals a higher chance of being rescued than the currently have, it gives those looking to purchase a pet an alternate option, as well as highlight animal shelters and the issue to the public.  For instance, if we could just save ten percent of dogs given up in the USA alone, we have the potential to save around 67,000 animals, which is still incredible. (Figure 2, a dog waiting to be rescued)</p>
	<span class="image main"><img src="images/Figure 6.png" alt="" /></span>
	<h2 class="major">Description</h2>

<p>This application will be primarily targeted to those who are looking to adopt a pet and/or help contribute to shelter animals, individuals who are wanting to put their pet up for adoption, as well as animal shelters and other organisations that deal with abandoned pets. </p>

<p>Upon opening the application, the user (adopter) will be required to sign up and create their own personal profile, including their full name, location, living conditions (do they have a back yard or not?) and finally their preferred animal being either a dog or a cat as well as its sex, breed, colour, size, etc. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if the user is looking to put their animal up for adoption, they must also include pictures of their animal to show potential adopters, proof of ownership over the animal (e.g., a microchip and documentation details).  This is to prevent fraud from taking place throughout the processes (only verified users will be able to put animals up for adoption, ownership details verified at exchange with the animal). </p>

<p>Once finishing the sign up and profile, users will be sent to a page of animals listed within their location and matching the preferences initially described. Users are then given the option to swipe left (dismiss) or right (shortlist) depending on whether the bio and pictures of the matched animal profiles spark their interests.</p>

<p>Furthermore, users will be able to make a contribution through the donation button, even if they do not adopt an animal, in which they will be allowed to send any sum of money to a registered shelter (not individuals) in order to support those organisations.  However, this donation feature will be present when contributing to an animal shelter, meaning that an individual putting their pet for adoption will not be able to receive any donations/nor will an individual be able to send donations, as these contributions will be only available for the animal shelters.</p>

<p>After deciding to swipe right for example, the listed animal will go on to their profiles shortlist.  From there, they can complete the transaction (like a check-out on eBay).  The animal profile would already have contact information for the shelter so inquiries about the animal and/or how to proceed with the transaction (will they go to pick up the animal, or will it be dropped off to their property?) could be done offline.  This is the area in which the two individuals can communicate and discuss any personal requests or ask further questions regarding the animal.  Additionally, in terms of payment, an individual purchasing an animal will also be given the option to ‘pay on pickup’.  Similarly, to ‘Facebook Marketplace’, an individual can choose to pay when picking up their chosen animal as opposed to through the application.</p>

<p>However, as this is a high-level project, we will need to further socialise through the use of surveys amongst the general public, as well as gaining more insight as to how animal shelters operate, in order to gain a better and more in depth understanding of what other features would be expected to implement into the application.  This would be done with the aim of raising the overall user experience and the quality of the final product.</p>

<br>
																				
<p>Here is a high-level list of features of the SAFE RAP application:</p>

<h3 class="major">SKILLS REQUIRED:</h3>

<p> - <b>Marketing ability:</b>  In order for the users to know of the application, marketing of the application in various channels will be needed.  </p>

<p> - <b>Coding:</b>  Mobile app development in our chosen languages is required.  </p>

<p> - <b>Cloud Infrastructure:</b>   Understanding of using various cloud technologies, licensing and connectivity is required.  </p>

<p> - <b>Security:</b>   Understanding of security rules regarding protecting user privacy and authentication methods is needed. </p>

<p> - <b>Communication:</b>   Team members will need to be able to communicate with each other to deliver the final application. </p>

<p> - <b>Design:</b>   Skills in user experience and design and associated tools such as Figma are needed to develop a prototype.  </p>

<p> -<b>Testing:</b>   Skills in testing methods and processes are required to ensure a better-quality code.  </p>

<p> -<b>Database:</b>   Skills in NoSQL databases (Firebase) and relational databases to create backend databases.  </p>

<h2 class="major">OUTCOME:</h2>

If this project is successful, the problem of the thousands of animals who are placed in animal shelters and are euthanized each year will hopefully be reduced worldwide.  Whilst this application will most likely not completely solve this issue, it aims to reduce the numbers as much as possible.  As there would be a centralised application for all shelters and people to use, it would be easier for all to view animals, adopt, or just donate.  Currently people need to look up these things from many different sources, or just go to the ones they know about.  Making something easier like this application would do, would help get more users.  So, having more users, making it easier, should reduce the numbers and help rescue animals.  As previously mentioned, just a small percentage saved translates to thousands of animals.   </p>

 							<h2 class="major">Reflection</h2>
 						  	<p><b>Group Reflection: Olympus</b></p>
								<p><b>> What went well?</b> <br>
									As a group, we were able to communicate effectively and efficiently.  This helped us with our organisation and ability to stay on track.  Furthermore, the group ensured that each member met their deadlines (in terms of the task they were allocated with), thus allowing the group to progress further with the project.  Additionally, our diverse backgrounds and interests allowed us to gain different perspectives on the IT industry.  This has benefited us as it has broadened our knowledge within this area of expertise. </p>

								<p><b>> What could be improved?</b> <br>
									An area in which we could have improved was our initial time management.  As a group we initially did not organise our time effectively.  To improve on this, the following assignment we will take advantage of extra time by ensuring that we begin as soon as possible. Next time we also need to ensure that we read through the brief thoroughly so that we know exactly what we must do and don’t underestimate certain sections.  This can further assist in organisation and allows us to plan more accurately when we should set deadlines and how long things should take. </p>

								<p><b>> At least one thing that was surprising? </b> <br>
									We found it pleasantly surprising that each member was able to simultaneously work on the GitHub repository.  Furthermore, we were also surprised at our ability to delegate roles fairly throughout the entirety of this project.  If one person did extra work, we were able to compensate for that as we continued our project.  Also, the fact that the weekly meetings were required seemingly benefitted us more than we initially believed.  By having two to three weekly meetings, our group were able to consistently stay on schedule (allowing for assistance to other group members within these meets as well). </p>

								<p><b>> At least one thing that you have learned about groups. </b> <br>
									In order to work in a group effectively, we have learnt to respect and acknowledge that everyone has their own way of completing varying tasks.  We also learned to comply with everyone’s time schedules and different learning techniques. Despite the differences of each member, individual members also bring more resources to the group than one person alone. Working in a group has taught us that no one way of thinking is certain and having more minds on a subject reveal's ideas unbeknownst to any specific individual.  </p>
			
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>		
							
							<p><b> Naveen: </b></p>
							<p>Overall, we as a team were able to work together and deliver something that we were proud of.</p>
							<p>The team was able to make decisions, delegate roles and stick to deadlines quite well. We didn’t have many disagreements and when we did, we respectfully shared our opinions and came to a joint resolution. </p>
							<p>In hindsight, we could have utilised our initial time a lot better. Although this did not in any way effect our quality, having that extra time would have given us just a bit more breathing room which can be helpful when assignments for other subjects fall at similar times.</p>
							<p>One thing that was extremely surprising was how helpful using teams for compulsory meetings was. The compulsory meetings really helped us keep on top of our work and allowed us to collaborate efficiently whilst also ensuring everyone was contributing.</p>
							<p>I have learnt that the best way to work through a group project is in person or over a video call. It really makes a big difference when you can verbally put across information and communicate with others as its accurate and allows for natural conversations.  When everyone just did their own things, it ruined the flow and prompted to many changes, however working together and being able to discuss ideas I believe had the best outcome.</p>
 	
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
									<p><b> Angelo:</b></p>
									<p><b>> What went well?</b> <br>
										Overall, the whole group experience went well, there was no problems, or any arguments and we all respected each other's opinions and viewpoints. Each member had evenly split up workloads and everyone got their work done by the due dates we set for each other, furthermore no individual tried to escape from work and felt responsible to accept work. </p>

									<p><b>> What could be improved?</b> <br>
										In hindsight, we started a little late and could have spaced out our workload over a larger period, so in future groups we could take advantage of the whole assignment period creating a smoother sailing when doing the assessment. Additionally, I would have liked more physical group meetups as I tend to procrastinate at home, so setting a studious environment would boost my effectiveness.  </p>

									<p><b>> At least one thing that was surprising? </b> <br>
										Honestly it was surprising that everyone got even workloads and submitted their work on time which created an efficient workload. This is surprising because of the stories I've heard of group work in universities.  </p>

									<p><b>> At least one thing that you have learned about groups. </b> <br>
										I’ve learned that groups are extremely effective and efficient when splitting tasks up and every individual gets their workload done as my previous experiences in groups from high school were the complete opposite and it was mostly 1-2 people getting all the work done.   </p>
									
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
							<p><b> Stephen: </b></p>
							<p> Although we started a couple of weeks later (still not too late by any means), I found that our group worked cohesively over past weeks to develop our project.  At all stages of the project, we were all able to give input on what we thought, as well as how we thought to go about answering a question.</p> 
							<p> Furthermore, we were able to fairly and without any disagreements, come to a decision on what project we should focus on but also the amount of work dedicated to each person.</p>
							<p> Additionally, it was our two-to-three meetings per week that I believe to have extremely helped us manage and stay on task, further urging each member to finish their task by given dates. These meetings also allowed for further group discussion surrounding varying parts of the assignments and gave an opportunity to allow for any uncertainties between members to be answered.</p>
							<p> Overall, we worked well as a group, as at no point did, we feel pressured by the time allocation given, allowing for us to complete in a timely and calm manner.</p> 
							<p> Following into the next group assignment, however, an improvement would be to better allocate time to meet and discuss the topic.  While we were able to meet around three times a week, it was at times quite difficult to have everyone be online at the same time.</p>        
							
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
							<p><b> Nivain: </b></p>
							<p>The group managed to stay organised by completing their assigned tasks within set deadlines each week, this allowed our team to stay on top of what needs to be completed before the final deadline. Each group member found it easy to share their own thoughts or ideas, making it easier to reach a consensus on a certain task.</p>
							<p>Improving our time management could have helped us complete the assignment earlier on. Even though we created an agenda and had around 2-3 meetings per week, we were able to complete the assignment and finalise everything on the last week. Utilising the time provided for this assignment would have allowed us to make minor adjustments that would increase our chance of receiving a higher mark.</p>
							<p>I found the effectiveness of the group meetings surprising. I initial thought the meetings were forced upon us, but it truly allowed us to stay on track and help other group members if they were struggling with a task. The meetings were also an effective method of communicating between each group member since we were able to verbally express our ideas.</p>
							<p>Groups can be used effectively to accomplish tasks within a set time frame. By assigning tasks to each group member, we were able to smoothly progress the assignment without any significant setbacks.</p>
