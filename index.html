<h2 class ="nametitle"> Group Processes </h2>
<p>Over the course of assignment two, our team worked cohesively to develop our idea into a project, and we continuously strived to improve and polish it until the deadline approached. Meetings were scheduled three times a week (one in-person, two online), and while it may have seemed like overkill and a chore in the beginning, those meetings became small little milestone points for us, in which we could see where we were all up to and we could discuss what needed to be done by the next meeting. It was in our first group meeting together that we introduced ourselves and got to know each other a little, but more importantly, we made it clear what our objective was, and we understood that a failure to deliver our respective workloads meant that we were not just letting ourselves down, but the whole team. </p>
<p>On top of that, our communication even outside of the meetings was almost constant, with members sending messages asking for assistance, confirming working was complete and even suggesting improvements for other’s work. We divvied the work as a group, trying to be fair where we could, and tried to accommodate for individual interests and strengths. As a group, we all felt as if we were on the same page.  </p>
<p>One of our areas of improvement we would like to work on was our time management early into the project, where we squandered almost two weeks of time over the mid-semester break. This did not end up affecting us too badly as we were able to effectively manage our remaining time, however this upcoming assessment will have a shorter timeframe and a larger workload meaning every extra day counts.  </p>
<p>Another area for improvement would be that due to the project being Stephens, he had to take on a larger workload than the rest of the group, but now that everyone has a good understanding on the project and a grasp on what needs to be accomplished, we can delegate the workload more evenly- so that each one of us has an equal share of the work. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class ="nametitle">Career Plans</h2>
<p>Generally, everyone’s career plan and ideal jobs did not change between assignment 1 and assignment 2. The lack of career plan changes could be due to everyone initially creating a solid and reasonable plan which highlights a clear pathway into the steps that should be taken to acquire a position at their ideal job.</p>
<p>Some similarities we found across every group member’s career plan includes completing required certifications, extending the Information Technology course to gain more skills and knowledge which may increase their likelihood of getting a placement at their ideal job. Another common factor within our group member’s career plans were searching for internships during the second year of university where training is provided.</p>
<p>Most career plans followed a similar pathway, however some pathways had slight differences compared to the rest of the career plans. Under Stephen’s career plan, he is hoping to find someone that has experience in the field of Solutions Architecture since he will be able to gain a clearer understanding of the requirements and skills needed in order to successfully find a placement at a Solutions Architecture job.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Description</h2>
								<br>
								<br>
													      
<h2 class="major">Overview</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="nametitle">Topic:</h2>
<p>Thousands of animals are euthanized each year in the USA and Australia alone.  This application will seek to reduce these numbers.  “SAFE RAP” will be available on both mobile platforms (IOS/Android) and will be aimed towards individuals looking to adopt a pet or otherwise looking to contribute to shelter animals.  Furthermore, “SAFE RAP” will also be catered for Animal shelters as well as other organisations that deal with abandoned pets, allowing them to put the animal up for adoption via the application. </p> 
<br>
 

<p>"SAFE RAP” will primarily run similarly to a ‘dating app’, in which the animals (primarily dogs and cats) will be put on the page, to which the users are able to swipe left or right depending on which they are interested in. Information is exchanged as well as any payment for animals rescued. Furthermore, as mentioned before, some individuals may not look to adopt but instead contribute in a different manner.  If this is the case, users will also be given the option to donate to their chosen animal shelter/s.  </p>        
<br>
 
<p>Over long term, “SAFE RAP” will have ideally allowed for thousands of animals across the world to be given a greater chance of life, with the likelihood of being euthanized reduced, whilst giving those looking to adopt an animal and alternative option to do so.</p>
<br>
	
<h2 class="nametitle">Motivation:</h2>
<br>
<p>The number of dogs and cats put in shelters and euthanized each year is alarmingly high.  “Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats)” in the U.S. alone (Pet Statistics 2015, para. 2) with a total of “28,072” dogs, and “45,364” cats being brought into the RSPCA in the 2019-2020 financial year (RSPCA 2021, para. 3) .  </p>
<br>
 
<p>Whilst this application may not solve the problem at hand, it gives the animals a higher chance of being rescued than the currently have, it gives those looking to purchase a pet an alternate option, as well as highlight animal shelters and the issue to the public.  For instance, if we could just save ten percent of dogs given up in the USA alone, we have the potential to save around 67,000 animals, which is still incredible.  </p>
<h2 class="nametitle">Landscape:</h2>
<br>
<p>Currently, there are applications such as Petfinder Mobile, LikeThat Pets, and AllPaws, that recently have made mobile applications to allow for individuals to adopt an animal.  Similarly, to our application “SAFE RAP”, Petfinder Mobile allows the individual to “view animals in [their] area and around the country, search animals of a specific breed, gender, or size, and read all about each animal.” (Lansdowne 2015, para. 5.).  In terms of functionality, the most similar applications are those made for dating, such as Tinder for example.  This is due to the similar mechanics, including, the swiping functions, liking/disliking, etc.  In terms of pet adoption, the previously mentioned applications, allow for pet adoption, however, differ primarily through their inability to allow for other contributions to be made via donations to chosen shelters. </p>

								<br>
								<br>
								<h2 class="nametitle">Aim:</h2>
								<p>Our overall aim for our project for the due date would be a working prototype of the app, in which we can navigate through functions and features and to get some of the main features into a working state. These main features include a home screen, profile pages and a donation screen. We will largely be using Figma to create our app prototype, and other artifacts will be created using other means. </p>
								<br>
								<h2 class="nametitle">Plans And Progress:</h2>
								<p>Thousands of animals are euthanized each year in the USA and Australia alone. This application seeks to reduce those numbers. “SAFE RAP” will be both an Android and IOS application targeted towards those who are looking to adopt a pet and/or help contribute to shelter animals. This application will also be catered for Animal shelters and other organizations that deal with abandoned pets, allowing them to put the animal up for adoption via the application. This application will primarily run similar to a ‘dating app’, in which the animals (primarily dogs and cats) will be put on the page with a small bio, to which the users are able to swipe left or right depending on which they are interested in. Information is exchanged as well as any payment for animals rescued. Users will also be able to donate to the animal shelters.</p>								
								<br>
								<p>This application will be primarily targeted to those who are looking to adopt a pet and/or help contribute to shelter animals, individuals who are deciding whether or not they should put their pet up for adoption, as well as animal shelters and other organizations that deal with abandoned pets.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Upon opening the application, the user will be required to sign up and create their own personal profile, including their full name, location, living conditions (do they have a back yard or not?) and finally their preferred animal being either a dog or a cat as well as its sex, breed, and size.  The living conditions here is to see if they can own such an animal (is the animal too large for their property?). The signing up feature adds a touch of personalization as well to the app allowing users to really define their preferences and create a list of pets, they are interested in.</p>
								<br>
								<p>On the other hand, if the user is looking to put their animal up for adoption, they must also include pictures of their animal to show potential adopters, proof of ownership over the animal (through a microchip and documentation) and furthermore have this verified by the company before being able to put the animal up for adoption.  This is to prevent scams from taking place throughout the processes (only verified users will be able to put animals up for adoption).</p>
								<br>
								<p>Once finishing the sign up and profile, users will be sent to a page of animals listed within their country and which were like the preferences initially described, to which they are then given the option to swipe left or right depending on whether the bio and pictures of the seen accounts spark their interests. There is also a settings window that can be opened, and there the user may select preferences on distance, type of animal and the size of the animal.</p>
								<br>
								<p>The signing up feature is a simple concept overall, and in our project, user create an account with their email first and then fill in the details in the profile setting which allows the users to create profile dependent on what they want to do on the app which includes: verifying your account, becoming an adopter, registering a pet for adoption, and partnering your shelter with our app. In concept the user would have to register their account through their phone number instead of email as phone numbers are usually registered to one person, resulting in less “spam” account and more active ones. Additionally, as another concept we thought about verifying your ID’s from driver's license to passport to prevent any anonymous misdemeanors resulting from use of our app. Similarly, when shelters decided to partner with us and register on our app, we would have to verify their ABN which was not in our scope but something we would have to plan on if continuing our project.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Furthermore, in the case of an individual not being able to adopt an animal due to any number of reasons, they will still be able to make a contribution through the donation button, in which they will be allowed to send any sum of money with the goal of ideally preventing any number of animals from the possibility of being euthanized.  After deciding to swipe right for example, the listed animal will go on to their profiles shortlist.  This will allow the user to scroll through the animals they are interested in and then contact the breeder with any inquiries about the animal and/or how to proceed with the transaction (will they go to pick up the animal, or will it be dropped off to their property?).</p>
								<br>
								<p>However, as this is a high-level project, we will need to further socialise through the use of surveys amongst the general public as well as gaining more insight as to how animal shelters operate in order to gain a better and more in depth understanding as to what other features need to be expected and implemented into the application, with the aim of raising the overall user experience and final product.</p>
								<br>
								<p>The donation section of the app is one of the most important features. Our main aim is to assist animals that do not have a home. Unfortunately for many, some animals spend far too long at the shelter. Adopting a pet is a big commitment and not everyone can afford that. However, just as important as adopting a pet is donating to one of our shelters on our app. With the donations, shelters can ensure that all animals have the best home possible until a proper home is found. The donations can contribute to many things such as bedding, food, medical supplies and so much more.</p>
								<br>
								<p>There would be a profile for each target audience/users of the application. Individuals looking to adopt a pet and/or help contribute to shelter animals. Those who are wanting to put their pet up for adoption (Animal owner). Animal shelters and other organizations that deal with abandoned pets.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Within the app, the user will have different options when it comes to setting up a profile. There are three different profile options, animal profile, shelter profile and adopter profile, additionally there is a user profile which is a general profile that everyone has to create in order to complete their ID verification. The user profile requires the user to add a profile picture, write a brief description about themselves. Fill out their full name, address, email address, phone number and to complete the ID verification in order to start using the app. The user will not be able to complete their sign up if they don’t complete the ID verification, this feature is implemented in the user profile to avoid any suspicious accounts from interacting with genuine buyers/sellers of pets.</p>
								<br>
								<p>The animal profile is a profile for the animal that is being advertised. The animal profile requires the user to add images of their pet and write a description/temperament. They also have to provide details on the animal’s breed, sex, age, colour, whether the animal is desexed, vaccinated or microchipped. Finally, the user has to provide a planned authorization date. The animal profile should also be completed by buyers/sellers since the animal profile will be displayed on the main page to other users of the app.</p>
								<br>
								<p>The shelter profile is intended for shelters who are looking to advertise their animals in the hopes of an adopter who is looking to adopt a pet. The shelter profile requires the shelter to add images of their shelter as well as images of the animal so the adopter can decide whether the shelter is reputable or not. The shelter needs to add a description/temperament on how the animal grew up in the shelter, there are other requirements such as name of shelter, address, email address, phone number and business number.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Finally, the adopter profile is intended towards those who are looking to adopt a pet. Several characteristics are required to be completed to find the most suitable pet. The adopter is required to add a profile image and a description so the seller can decide if the adopter is trustworthy. These characteristics are full name, address, email address, phone number, property details, whether they own any other pets, the size of their family and the number of children and finally the characteristic preferences of their pet. The adopter is required to provide property details to figure out their living environments/conditions. They are also required to answer whether they own any other pets to figure out if their new pet live with any other pets. The number of family members will be used to figure out if the pet is capable of living in an environment with people.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2 class="nametitle">Goals:</h2>
								<h2 class="nametitle">Prototype App</h2>
								<p>This will serve as a skeleton or a beta version of the app that can be used to demonstrate keypaths that users will go through and give an idea of how the app will feel at the end of the development process. Key pages will be designed for the purpose of logging-in, registering, donating, creating a profile, messaging and a main page in which users can swipe through listings of animals from shelters. </p>
								<h2 class="nametitle">Swipe Function</h2>
								<p>Our application’s main page will feature ‘cards’ that users can either swipe left or right to determine whether or not the user will be matched with the animal later down the line. These cards can be expanded to view more information and photos of these animals and other features such as ‘Follow’ or a ‘Super like’ could be experimented with. This page will be the main site of interaction for users and having this function working as intended and streamlined will be a big advancement in the development of our app. </p>
								<h2 class="nametitle">Payment System</h2>
								<p>Our app will need an inbuilt payment system so that transactions between parties can be traced and potential scammers can be tracked down. This payment system will not only be used for any required payments from an adopter to a shelter, but from any willing user to donate to a shelter. Our motivation for the app is to lower the number of animals being euthanized, and this is largely due to shelters being unable to financially support or foster any more animals. </p>
								<h2 class="nametitle">Location System</h2>
								<p> A big factor that comes into play when matching potential adopters and shelters would be the geographic location of the two parties. This feature would need the location of both parties and figure out the distance, and based on the adopter’s preferences of distance, match the parties. </p>

								<br>
								<br>
                <h2 class="nametitle">Roles:</h2>
								<p>In terms of roles for our project, we did not necessarily have any set roles. The only person who was consistently in a role was Stephen as lead developer. The reason why Stephen was lead on the project is due to the main idea being his. This allowed for a clear, unique vision that could be implemented and changed to suit the overall goal. As for the rest of the group, all of us have similar interchangeable skill sets. Naveen took an overall leadership role by organizing meetings, agendas, the report, and the website. In terms of prototype development, research, etc. All members were able to divide the work somewhat evenly and successfully complete the task. Overall, our skills are quite similar and therefore allowed us to be flexible with the work and not limit people to specific roles.</p>
								<br>
							  <br>
								<h2 class="nametitle">Scope and Limits:</h2>
								<p>
									The scope of our project SAFE-RAP is to create a deeper effort in the adoption of household animals, saving them from euthanasia and growing old in adoption centres. Through mobile devices, as nowadays almost everyone carries mobile devices, our project creates an easier opportunity for those who want to adopt and save animals using a simple mobile application. However, as this project is being developed in a strict timeframe, we are focusing on providing some artifacts about the main features / pages which include:<br>

									<br>1.	Creation of accounts (Signing up / Singing in)<br>
									This feature will create a more personalised experience with the use of the app allowing the user to tinker with the application to how they see fit, also allowing them to shortlist animals they are interested in.<br>

									<br>2.	Main page.<br>
									The main page, showing the user the animals that are currently up for adoption, allowing the user to swipe left to shortlist the animals and swipe right to skip the animals. This page also includes accessibility controls at the bottom of the screen with buttons to: Go back, skip, shortlist and donate.<br>

									<br>3.	User profile.<br>
									The user profile page consists of different subpages the app has available for users with differing purposes these sub-pages include; User, Animal, Shelter and Adopter. Every user fall under the “User” subpage, forcing them to provide ID Verification to prove their identity. The “Animal” subpage allows the users to register animals they would like to put up for adoption, prompting the user to detail the animal as much as possible and includes fields that are required to fill in. The “Shelter” subpage allows the user to register their business as an animal shelter on our app. The idea behind this is to decrease verification time and increase trust when listing animals that are under the shelters name, however given the timeframe we must work on this project, this is not within our scope but something that would be included if we had more time. The final subpage “Adopter” allows the user to input further information about themselves allowing the animal listers to have a more in-depth view on the adopter.<br>

									<br>4.	Settings.<br>
									The setting page focuses on the user’s preferences, this include the location range, how far away they are willing to go, what kind of pets they are looking for, an option to update information about themselves and allowing them to create profiles for their pets and shelters.<br>

									<br>5.	Donations.<br>
									The donations page will allow the users that cannot adopt pets to still offer their help through donations to a select few shelters such as: RSPCA, Animal Aid and Zoobie.<br>

									<br>However, features such as the verification of users and ABN’S is not within our scope but just proof of concept in the artifacts we are providing. Furthermore, our goal of having a location, matching and payment system is not within our scope but is another goal we are aiming if we had more time to develop our project.

<h2 class="nametitle">Testing:</h2>								
<p>We will be testing our project through the use of Appium.  Appium is an “open-source tool for testing a wide range of applications, including mobile web, native, and hybrid apps.” (idapgroup 2020, para. 7.).  We will begin our limited testing after finalising our prototypes of the applications features through Figma.  The user testing process will begin in week 10 of this project, with the following user testing (Beta Stage) being conducted in week 13.  In this, we will ask a limited number of individuals to perform various tasks, whilst using our application to determine whether these are easily achievable by the average user.  Upon the results of these tests, we will continue to update the application as well as possible to benefit the user's overall user-experience whilst navigating through and using the application.</p>

		<h2 class="nametitle">Risks</h2>
		<p>There were a few risks we had to consider during assignment 3. We initially decided to use Proto.io to complete our prototype for the app, the first risk we ran into was that Proto.io requires the user to select a payment plan in order to have access to its full set of features. Although they included a 15-day free trial, we did not want to risk losing access to our prototype midway through the assignment, therefore we decided to complete our prototype through Figma which offers many useful features for free.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Another risk we considered before starting our prototype was the export feature, Proto.io allowed us to export our prototype in many ways but we found it a bit confusing to use the export feature. We simply chose Figma’s method of exporting the prototype since it was easier to use and understand.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The final risk we considered when it came to software was collaborating on the prototype at the same time between each member of the group. Proto.io allowed us to share the project between our group members so we can all work on the prototype, however it was slightly glitchy since some of the changes made by one group member will not update on the other group member's screen which made it difficult to progress through the prototype since it was inefficient. Figma also has a collaborate feature which works well, we were able to see the changes made in a few seconds which made it easy to understand what part everyone was working on. Additionally, we were able to see each group member’s cursor on our screen which indicates what part they are currently working on, this also made it easier to make changes without causing any major disruptions to other group member’s work.</p>
		<br>
		<p>We also considered some risks within our project idea. The first and major risk within our project idea was the safety of pets and its owners. Listing a pet on a public platform can be a risk towards the users of the app since the likelihood of a scam occurring can be high if the individual is not careful about a certain situation or whether a deal seems “too good to be true”. In our defence, apps such as Gumtree, eBay and Facebook Marketplace allows its users to list an item publicly and it is simply up to the user to consider the potential risks and scams coming from other suspicious users. These apps, and similar to our app, are only intended to help people connect with others so they can sell their item with ease. However, we have considered the likeliness of a scam occurring, we decided to implement a user profile feature which requires the user to complete a set of questions and a user ID verification.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Other risks can include meeting up with others to buy or sell a pet, fake listings, online payment transactions to buy or sell a pet and user profile questions falsely/incorrectly answered. As mentioned previously, these risks are risks that can derive from suspicious users across the app and these potential risks and scams should be identified by the user before progressing onto the next step of buying/selling a pet.</p>
		<br>
		<br>


								<br>
							  <br>
								<h2 class="nametitle">Group Processes and Communication</h2>
								<p>At the start of the project, we as a group had a discussion and tried to find times that we were all available. This allowed us to create a schedule in which our meetings would take place. This was very valuable as it ensured that the work and meeting completed was done as a team and not individually. We chose to use Teams for all our meetings and used class time for face to face discussions. Working as a group allows multiple points of views and flow amongst the report. Although we allotted free time to meet, sometimes things come up and individuals are unable to join the meeting. We alleviated this issue by scheduling, 3 meetings, consistently updating the actions and being clear and concise in our meetings. By doing this, even if someone missed a meeting, they would be able to catch up and get back on track. Luckily, we didn’t have issues in terms of group members not responding. However if we did encounter this issue, we would either continue and report it to Anthony, if the member came back before we reported the issue, we would inform them of what has happened and ensure work was distributed fairly to reflect their lack of communication. Overall, fortunately our group processes and communication suffered little to no issues.</p>

									<h2 class="nametitle">Group Reflection: Olympus</h2>
									<br>
									<h3>What went well?</h3>
									<br>
									<p>As a group, we were able to communicate effectively and efficiently.  This helped us with our organisation and ability to stay on track.  Furthermore, the group ensured that each member met their deadlines (in terms of the task they were allocated with), thus allowing the group to progress further with the project.  Additionally, our diverse backgrounds and interests allowed us to gain different perspectives on the IT industry.  This has benefited us as it has broadened our knowledge within this area of expertise. We found it easy to use software such as Figma to help us develop out prototype. At first, we thought Figma was difficult to use and understand but we eventually learned how to implement each feature within out prototype.</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
									<p>An area in which we could have improved was our time management.  As a group we did not organise our time effectively and this led to us only being able to create one artefact. In our future studies, we as a group need to organise and plan thoroughly to achieve the best mark. Although we met the basic requirements for the artefact, we all want to do well and not organizing our time properly was a downfall for that. Overall, we felt like we did really well, but definitely could have done better with our time management.</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
									<p>We found it pleasantly surprising that each member was able to simultaneously work on the GitHub repository.  Furthermore, we were also surprised at our ability to delegate roles fairly throughout the entirety of this project.  If one person did extra work, we were able to compensate for that as we continued our project.  Also, the fact that the weekly meetings were required seemingly benefitted us more than we initially believed.  By having two to three weekly meetings, our group were able to consistently stay on schedule (allowing for assistance to other group members within these meets as well).</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h2 class="nametitle">Individual Responses:</h2>
									<br>
									<h3>Nivain:</h3>
									<br>
									<p>Our group managed to collaborate effectively to complete different parts of the assignment such as the contents in the report and the prototype. We improved our time efficiency by assigning roles to each team member, this also meant that everyone in the group was aware of what their roles were and what needs to be completed before the set deadlines for each week. Creating an agenda before each meeting was useful towards the members of the group, the agenda motivated us to complete our set tasks with detail.</p>
									<br>
									<p>One thing I found surprising was the software we used to create our prototype. I initially thought developing an app would be difficult but once I started exploring through Figma, I learnt what each feature does and how to use that feature correctly in the prototype. Once I started to familiarise myself with Figma, I found it easy to complete my section of the prototype.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Whilst working in the group, I learnt how everyone’s creative and analytical thinking can play a crucial role in improving the quality of our work. This stood out to me during our prototyping stage, each member had their own way of implementing different features into the prototype which brought up new ideas. I believe everyone’s creative thinking allowed us to envision what our prototype was going to look like once it was finished.</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h3>Naveen:</h3>
									<br>
									<p>Overall, I believe that my group worked extremely well. We were able to communicate effectively and ensure everyone was pulling their weight. We made improvements from our group reflection last assignment. In our last reflection we talked about how our initial time management wasn’t great and was an area we could improve on. Although we still needed some time management improvement to add more artefacts, we definitely improved our initial time management. We were able to utilise the time at the start to organize ourselves and set ourselves up for success.</p>
									<br>
									<p>One thing I found surprising was how easy it was to use Figma simultaneously. Although we had experience with Figma during user centered design, we only used the wireframes at that point. Originally, we were going to use Proto.Io, however we had some issues with the subscription. We were disappointed that we had to use Figma, however in hindsight I believe it was a great decision. Figma is extremely powerful and has so much content related to it for assistance. It was easy to use and allowed us to make a great artefact.</p>
									<br>
									<p>I really enjoyed working with my group as everyone had great ideas and new implementations. We were able to take Stephen's idea and improve it by all inputting suggestions and making the app as best we could in the given time frame. Overall, I was quite happy in the group.</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h3>Angelo:</h3>
									<br>
									<p>
										During these past assignments I have surprisingly enjoyed working with this group, I thought from previous experiences that group work was going to be painful and slow, but over all this group has proved to be extremely diligent and helpful. The group always designated roles as evenly as possible, and we divided the marks as we saw fit. Despite unfortunately only using Figma as an artifact, I believe that we made it as realistic as possible.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>
										I found it surprising how finnicky Android Studio as I wanted to make at least a mockup that we could use as a physical artifact but the software kept running into problems with my computer and was really confusing as I did not understand the programming language. So instead of focusing our time on something we may not have completed I saw that it was a good decision that we invested more time into Figma rather than something we did not know how to use. I also found it surprising how quickly a project can come to completion when each member gets their work evenly, and thought it magic when I open the report and I see everyone’s parts coming together.
									</p>
										<br>
										<p>
											Overall, I really enjoyed working with this group, there were no arguments, and everyone seemed to have a chill time. I really appreciated that when someone believed you were doing something incorrectly or it could be improved upon, they would give you feedback without being harsh or too hard. In conclusion the group I felt really relaxed with the group and was able to get my part of the work done with the help of the group.
										</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h3>Stephen:</h3>
									<br>
									<p>Overall, our group was able to successfully and methodically work through this assignment.  From the beginning, we were able to collaborate quite easily whilst maintaining an equal and fair workload for each member.  Whilst our time management was a bit off at the beginning, we managed to pull it together, and moved forward very well as a group, making sure our meetings were always scheduled prior, to allow us to prepare beforehand and furthermore to distribute tasks and discuss varying opportunities as we saw fit.</p>   
									<br>
 
									<p>One thing that I found surprising with the assignment would be primarily regarding Figma, our tool for building our artefact.  Initially, we had decided to use Proto.Io as our tool, however, were ultimately unable to.  Despite this, Figma turned out to be quite manageable to work cohesively and in the end, allowed us to create a well-developed prototype of our application. </p>
									<br>
 
									<p>Finally, over this period of time, despite being hesitant at the beginning, I have very much enjoyed working with and being a part of this group.  Throughout this course, I have gotten along well with them, and believe that we have been able to build of each other, with all members of the group giving constructive feedback, depending on how they felt, thus allowing for varying elements and ideas to be explored and in turn improved.  In conclusion, it has been a pleasure working with this group and getting to meet each of them, whilst being able to develop and build on our project together.</p>
